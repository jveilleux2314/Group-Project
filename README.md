# The Rise of K-Pop
What makes certain songs popular? Using Spotify's API and historical data from Billboard's Hot 100 songs chart, we will break popular songs down to identify trends and try to determine what makes K-Pop songs popular.

If we are successful, we will be able to train a machine learning model on the components of popular songs and their rankings to determine how long a song will stay on the Hot 100 Billboard.

### Why K-Pop?
K-Pop is short for Korean popular music, and its rise in popularity - as well as the dedication of its fans - has taken social media by storm. The cultural impact of K-Pop fans [was even highlighted by CNN in 2020](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/22/asia/k-pop-fandom-activism-intl-hnk/index.html), documenting the political activism of fans of groups like BTS.

### What Do We Hope to Find?
With as much social and purchasing power as these communities wield, it begs the question - is the popularity of Korean bands a fad? Or will their songs have staying power - and therefore the communities surrounding them?
